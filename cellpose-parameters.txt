flow_threshold:
The flow_threshold parameter is the maximum allowed error of the flows for each mask. The default is flow_threshold=0.4.
Increase this threshold if cellpose is not returning as many ROIs as you’d expect. Similarly, decrease this threshold if cellpose is returning too many ill-shaped ROIs.
cellprob_threshold:
they vary from around -6 to +6. The pixels greater than the cellprob_threshold are used to run dynamics and determine ROIs. The default is cellprob_threshold=0.0.
Decrease this threshold if cellpose is not returning as many ROIs as you’d expect. Similarly, increase this threshold if cellpose is returning too ROIs particularly from dim areas.
